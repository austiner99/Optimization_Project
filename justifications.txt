### --- ID Bigrams / Trigrams --- ###
- Based on frequency and combinations 
- In order to simplify, not worrying about trigrams
- Also not worrying about position in word, just freq
- Common bigrams/trigrams are on the same position, different fingers
- See Isaac's drawing of pinky 4, ring 8, middle 8, pointer 8, and thumb 4
- Weight the center of the keys as the resting position




### --- ID min # of keys to mimic 2-handed keyboard
- All letters on 1 macro
- Macro shift to cap, number, or function
- Equations - mix of numbers and letters
- User friendly by minimizing # of macros





### --- Notes --- ###
- General procedure moving forward
    1. Optimize key location on generic, rectangular, one-handed keyboard with 
    limited number of keys 
    2. Optimize shape of keyboard and location of keyboard constrained by ergonomics
